desktop size >850px. 849px> tablet size >471px. 470px> mobile. However numerous px classes were used to accomodate the wording in the SDG 5 & 8 graphics
Could add a transition animation to the nav bar so that it detaches from the top when you navigate down the page. Could look slick AF. Also could add
Font Awesome icons to the contacts section, to make it look more professional...like LinkedIn and email icons.
Need to have the nav-bar links have full height in the bar because they are clumsy to click otherwise.
Should use Bootstraps, include scripts at the bottom to prevent it being top-heavy and not loading quickly.
Could make the header intially see-through and then change at 100px from the top. Maybe try setting the background of a whole section to be a picture
and then make the title div have a transparent background so that as you scroll it moves? Also would have to set the title font color to white?
Could maybe remove the bios and have a layout similar to Capria VC?
The site looks absolutely gorgeous if you hide the bodies of text and have the nav bar be the banners!!
Could I include blur effects on the nav-bar?
Add more dynamism to the header menu options, with transitions?
You could have transitions similar to :<https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/5a256d7ee1382366b93c6aab> or maybe have like a checkerboard cutout of
each page...and have it pop in diagonally from top left to bottom right with slight delays so it looks like its fading in? It would be best to use
the PNG format to create the transparency among the elements.
Check out designdrizzle.com for amazing CSS transitions
Should use a carousel for the events?
The news and event content should contain blog posts with regards to what we learnt at conference events or during events such as the WEOF Africa
tour (01/04/18 - 18/04/18)
Would be nice if there was a bounce animation on the fa-envelope icon and a grow animation on the LinkedIn icon
Could use a jquery to toggle the bios? So that when you click on view profile, it shows the person's info. Probably best if the info has width = 100% so
that it takes up as little vertical space as possible.
Also set the mugshot highlighted by maybe a background-color change for both the picture and bio!!
set that when a section is open the header gets smaller...
anchor height needs an if statement depending on the size of the header
Events should have an eternally scrolling slideshow of events
Can use .not(this) selector in jquery to shorten the coding and not have duplicate code
Can use "this" in jquery to prevent duplicate classes all being affected, shortening the jquery code required hugely
Can use ".ajax" to make information requests to include data from other sites
